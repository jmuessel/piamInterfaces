## Purpose of this PR



## Checklist:
- [ ] I added an `x` in column `exclude_remind2_validation` for all `piam_variable` not produced by `remind2::convGDX2MIF` (for example EDGE-T, MAgPIE)
- [ ] I did not use Excel to open csv files or checked that no side-effects occur (changed values, many new quotation marks, â€¦)

It is recommended to have a look at the [tutorial](https://github.com/pik-piam/piamInterfaces/blob/master/tutorial.md) before submission.
