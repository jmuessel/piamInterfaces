\arguments{
\item{mifs}{path to mif files or directories with mif files of a REMIND run,
or quitte object}

\item{mapping}{mapping template names such as c("AR6", "AR6_NGFS") or a vector of file names with mapping templates.
If NULL, the user is asked. Multiple templates are concatenated.}

\item{model}{name of model as registered with IIASA}

\item{removeFromScen}{regular expression to be removed from scenario name (optional). Example: '_d50|d95'}

\item{addToScen}{string to be added as prefix to scenario name (optional)}

\item{outputDirectory}{path to directory for the generated submission (default: output).
If NULL, no files are written and \code{logFile} and \code{outputFilename} have no effect.}

\item{outputFilename}{filename of the generated submission. Must be mif or xlsx file.
If NULL, submission data is returned.
If \code{outputDirectory} is set to NULL, this parameter has no effect.}

\item{logFile}{path to the logfile with warnings as passed to generateMappingfile, checkIIASASubmission
(default: outputDirectory/submission_log.txt). Set to FALSE for none.
If \code{outputDirectory} is set to NULL, this parameter has no effect.}

\item{iiasatemplate}{optional filename of xlsx or yaml file provided by IIASA
used to delete superfluous variables and adapt units}

\item{generatePlots}{boolean, whether to generate plots of failing summation checks}

\item{timesteps}{timesteps that are accepted in final submission}

\item{checkSummation}{either TRUE to identify summation files from mapping, or filename, or FALSE}

\item{mappingFile}{has no effect and is only kept for backwards-compatibility}
}
\description{
Generates an IIASA submission from REMIND or MAgPIE runs by applying a project-specific mapping.
The script starts from 'mifs' which can be a directory with mif files, a vector of files or a
quitte object. In outputDirectory/outputFilename, you will get the data in a joint xlsx or mif file.
}
\details{
To provide the mapping, two options exist:
\itemize{
\item If you want to generate the mapping from one or more mapping templates from the inst/templates folder,
set mapping = c("AR6", "AR6_NGFS") or so.
\item Alternatively, you can provide a path or a vector of paths to template files. If you provide your own template
files, make sure they follow the standard format (see \code{getTemplate} for more information)
\item It is also possible, to mix both options, e.g. c("AR6", "/path/to/template_file.csv")
}

In any case, multiple template files will be concatenated.

iiasatemplate is a xlsx or yaml file provided by IIASA with the variable + unit definitions that are
accepted in the database. The function 'priceIndicesIIASA' will be called to calculate price indices
that are missing or with the wrong base year. 'checkIIASASubmission' will be called to remove all variables
that are not accepted in the database.

For all elements of the parameter mapping that contain a summation file in inst/summations,
the function 'checkSummations' is called to verify variable summation checks.

To alter the data, you can use those parameters: model, addToScen, removeFromScen and timesteps.
